# Back End Development and APIs Projects (freeCodeCamp)

***This repository contains my solutions to the final projects of the Back End Development and APIs learning path of freeCodeCamp,
in which these topics are covered: npm, Node, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose.***

The last part of the [Back End Development and APIs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis) section on freeCodeCamp is the "Back End Development and APIs Projects", which includes five projects designed to solidify your skills in building APIs and back-end applications. These projects are 5 different microservices, which are smaller applications that are limited in scope, and serve as hands-on practice for working with Node.js, Express and MongoDB.

Here’s a brief overview of each project:
 - [Timestamp Microservice](https://github.com/ningia92/back-end-projects-fcc/tree/main/project-timestamp): API that returns the Unix timestamp and the UTC time when a date string is provided (or the current time if no date is given).
 - [Request Header Parser Microservice](https://github.com/ningia92/back-end-projects-fcc/tree/main/project-headerparser): API that parses details from the client request header, like the IP address, language, and software information, and returns it in JSON format.
 - [URL Shortener Microservice](https://github.com/ningia92/back-end-projects-fcc/tree/main/project-urlshortener): API that allows users to input a URL, stores it in a database, and provides a shortened version of the URL that redirects to the original one.
 - Exercise Tracker: API that lets users log exercise activities. The API keeps track of users, their exercises, and associated metadata like duration, date, and description.
 - File Metadata Microservice: microservice that allows users to upload a file, and the API responds with metadata about the file, such as size and type.
